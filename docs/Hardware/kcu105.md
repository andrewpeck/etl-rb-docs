# KCU105

## Configuring a new KCU 105 eval board

The clock configuration has to be changed on a new KCU 105.

* Connect UART port to computer.
* Check USB serial devices.
* `screen /dev/ttyUSB0 115200`, press any button if Main Menu does not show up automatically

This is the menu that should show up:
```
1. Set KCU105  Si570    User Clock Frequency
2. Set KCU105  Si5328   MGT  Clock Frequency
3. Save    KCU105 Clock Frequency  to  EEPROM
4. Restore KCU105 Clock Frequency from EEPROM
5. View    KCU105 Saved Clocks in EEPROM
6. Set KCU105 Clock Restore Options
7. Read KCU105 Si570    User Clock Frequency
8. Read KCU105 Si5328   MGT  Clock Frequency
0. Return to Main Menu
Select an option
```

* Set Programmable Clocks (1) -> Set KCU105 Si570 User clock frequency (1), 320.64MHz
* Save (3) -> (1) -> (0)
* To confirm view with (5)

we also need to Enable KCU105 Si570 Automatic Restore at Power-Up/Reset:

* Set KCU105 Clock Restore Options (6)
* Select option (2)
* Return to Clock Menu (0)

* ctrl+a, k to exit screen session
