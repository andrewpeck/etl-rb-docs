** Description

The Readout Board will be designed in 3 different flavors, called the RB-3, RB-6, and RB-7, where the suffix number represents the number of "full-modules" that the Readout Board services.

- {{{SPEC}}} An RB-3 will interface with 3 modules, meaning 12 ETROCs and 12 sensors.
- {{{SPEC}}} An RB-6 will interface with 6 modules, meaning 24 ETROCs and 24 sensors.
- {{{SPEC}}} An RB-7 will interface with 7 modules, meaning 28 ETROCs and 28 sensors.

The Readout Board consists of one or more lpGBTs, a GBT-SCA, a VTRX+, a number of linPOL12 regulators, and associated connectors / passive components required to interface with the external systems.

- {{{SPEC}}} Each RB will have 1 GBT-SCA
- {{{SPEC}}} Each RB will have 2 lpGBTs
- {{{SPEC}}} Each RB will have 1 VTRX+
- {{{SPEC}}} Each RB will have 6 linPOL12s
  - 2 for VTRX+ RX
  - 2 for VTRX+ TX
  - 1 for GBT-SCA analog power
  - 1 for GBT-SCA digital power

- {{{SPEC}}} These IO will be allocated as:
  #+CAPTION: Allocation of GPIO on the Readout Board
  |                | Source  |          RB-3 |          RB-6 |          RB-7 |
  |----------------+---------+---------------+---------------+---------------|
  | GBT-SCA RESETB | lpGBT   |             1 |             1 |             1 |
  | VTRX LD_RESETB | lpGBT   |             1 |             1 |             1 |
  | VTRX LD_DIS    | lpGBT   |             1 |             1 |             1 |
  | Module Reset   | GBT-SCA |             3 |             6 |             7 |
  | PB Good        | GBT-SCA | {{{UNKNOWN}}} | {{{UNKNOWN}}} | {{{UNKNOWN}}} |
  | PB Enable      | GBT-SCA | {{{UNKNOWN}}} | {{{UNKNOWN}}} | {{{UNKNOWN}}} |

- {{{SPEC}}} The module reset signals will be pulled *up* to the 1.2V lpGBT supply by the readout board
- {{{SPEC}}} The Power Good signals will be pulled *up* to the 1.2V lpGBT supply by the readout board
  - They are assumed to be open-collector or open-drain signals /without/ pullups on the DC/DC converters.
- {{{SPEC}}} The Power Enable signals will be pulled *down* to ground by the readout board.
  - They will be driven to 1.5V to enable the DC/DC converters. This is assumed to be sufficient to turn on the BPOL modules.

*** Uplinks

Uplinks carry data from the front-end to the back-end.

- {{{SPEC}}} These uplinks will *not* be phase length matched.

**** Quantity
  - {{{SPEC}}} RB-3 will have {{{UNKNOWN}}} uplinks
  - {{{SPEC}}} RB-6 will have {{{UNKNOWN}}} uplinks
  - {{{SPEC}}} RB-7 will have {{{UNKNOWN}}} uplinks
**** Data Rates
  - {{{SPEC}}} RB-3 will operate at up to {{{UNKNOWN}}} Mbps
  - {{{SPEC}}} RB-6 will operate at up to {{{UNKNOWN}}} Mbps
  - {{{SPEC}}} RB-7 will operate at up to {{{UNKNOWN}}} Mbps
*** Downlinks

Downlinks carry data from the back-end to the front-end.

- {{{SPEC}}} The Readout Board will deliver to each module two downlinks that provide a "fast command" interface to the ETROC.
- {{{SPEC}}} These fast-command downlinks will run at {{{UNKNOWN}}} Mbps.
- {{{SPEC}}} The fast command downlinks will be multi-dropped on the module, with each downlink serving 2 ETROCs.
  - 6 downlinks for the RB-3, 12 downlinks for the RB-6, and 14 downlinks for the RB-7.
- {{{SPEC}}} These downlinks will *not* be phase length matched /between/ modules, but *will* be phase length matched /within/ modules and to their respective clocks.
*** Clocking
- {{{SPEC}}} The Readout Board will be responsible for delivering a 40 MHz point-to-point clock to each of the ETROCs it connects to.
  - 12 clocks for the RB-3, 24 clocks for the RB-6, and 28 clocks for the RB-7.
- {{{SPEC}}} These clocks will *not* be phase length matched /between/ modules, but *will* be phase length matched /within/ modules.
- {{{SPEC}}} The clock will be distributed only from the *master* lpGBT; the slave lpGBT clock outputs will not be used due to radiation intolerance.
*** VTRX
** Monitoring

A GBT-SCA ASIC provides 31 analog inputs with 12-bit resolution, and 4 analog outputs with 8-bit resolution, with a range of 0 to 1V.

An lpGBT provides 8 analog inputs with 10-bit resolution and 1 analog output with 12-bit resolution.

The Readout Board will monitor the following analog channels:

#+begin_src elisp :exports none
;; (setq divider "82/100082")
;; (setq adc "GBT-SCA")
(cond ((string= type "Voltage")

              (lsb (/ 1 (* div num-levels)))
              ) (format "%4.3e V" lsb)))
