* Specifications

** Description

The readout board will be designed in 3 different flavors, called the RB-3, RB-6, and RB-7, where the suffix number represents the number of "full-modules" that the readout board services.

The readout board consists of one or more lpGBTs, a GBT-SCA, a VTRX+, a number of linPOL12 regulators, and associated connectors / passive components required to interface with the external systems.

- {{{SPEC}}} Each RB will have 1 GBT-SCA
- {{{SPEC}}} Each RB will have 2 lpGBTs
- {{{SPEC}}} Each RB will have 1 VTRX+
- {{{SPEC}}} Each RB will have 6 linPOL12s
  - 2 for VTRX+ RX
  - 2 for VTRX+ TX
  - 1 for GBT-SCA analog power
  - 1 for GBT-SCA digital power

** Interfaces

- {{{SPEC}}} The power board interface will use connector part number {{{UNKNOWN}}}.
- {{{SPEC}}} The pinout of these connectors is {{{UNKNOWN}}}.
- {{{SPEC}}} The placement of these connectors is {{{UNKNOWN}}}.
- {{{SPEC}}} The quantity of these connectors is {{{UNKNOWN}}}.
*** Module
**** Mechanical Interface

- {{{SPEC}}} The pinout of these connectors is {{{UNKNOWN}}}.
- {{{SPEC}}} The placement of these connectors is {{{UNKNOWN}}}.
*** Fiber Optic
The fiber optic interface to CMS is through a VTRX+. The readout board will host both the VTRX+, as well as the MT Ferrule that is required to connect between the VTRX+ and a "naked fanout".
- {{{SPEC}}} The size of the cutout for the MT ferrule is {{{UNKNOWN}}}.
- The location of the cutout for the MT ferrule is:
  - {{{SPEC}}} RB-3: {{{UNKNOWN}}}.

- {{{SPEC}}} The part number for the LV connector is {{{UNKNOWN}}}.
- {{{SPEC}}} The pinout for the LV connector is {{{UNKNOWN}}}.
- {{{SPEC}}} The placement for the LV connector is {{{UNKNOWN}}}.
** Signal Connectivity
*** I2C
- {{{SPEC}}} The GBT-SCA will provide one I2C connection for each module.
- {{{SPEC}}} All ETROCs in a module will share an I2C master.
- {{{SPEC}}} The readout board will provide strong I2C pull-ups.
  - It is assumed that the modules will not, and have only weak pull-ups.
*** SCA IO
*** Uplink E-links
*** Downlink E-links
*** Clocking
*** VTRX
** Monitoring

- {{{SPEC}}} Bias voltage monitoring will be through a resistive voltage divider:
  - It is formed of two 50Mohm resistors (HVC1206T5005JET) and one 82k resistor (RR0510P-823-D) with accuracy of 0.5% for each resistor.
  - The divider 82/100000=0.00082, providing a nominal monitoring range of 0-1219 volts.
  - The bias voltage will be monitored by the GBT-SCA.

- {{{SPEC}}} VTRX 2.5V will be monitored through a resistive voltage divider:
- {{{SPEC}}} GBTX 1.5V analog / digital will be monitored through a resistive voltage divider:

** Low Voltage Distribution
- {{{SPEC}}} The readout board will provide four 47 uF capacitors connected to each 1.2V ETROC supply.
  - There will be no additional filtering.
- {{{SPEC}}} Analog and digital power for the ETROC will not be distinguished.
- {{{SPEC}}} The low voltage will be ganged such that {{{UNKNOWN}}} ETROCs share a common power supply.
** Bias Voltage Distribution
